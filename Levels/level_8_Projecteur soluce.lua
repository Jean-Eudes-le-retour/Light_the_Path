-- LIST OF NOTEWORTHY GLOBAL VARIABLES --

>>    Grid     << All operations to modify Grid should go through grid functions UNLESS you know what you're doing!
table with Grid[x][y] (within game boundary) contaning nil or an Object

>>  canvas_OL  << Love canvases, are drawn in love.draw()
>>  canvas_BG  << 
canvas for the Overlay and the Background respectively; dimensions are (TEXTURE_BASE_SIZE*level.x,TEXTURE_BASE_SIZE*level.y)
They are updated (and thus reset) before level.update() ONLY IF global flags UpdateOverlayFG (->sort of a lie but effect is the same from outside perspective) and UpdateBackgroundFG evaluate to true
(which would be impossible in a regular game without developer mode enabled);

>>  game_time  << (double) The current time since start of the game in seconds. Do not modify.

TYPE_WALL, TYPE_GLASS, TYPE_SOURCE, TYPE_RECEIVER, TYPE_MIRROR, TYPE_PWHEEL, TYPE_PRISM;
COLOR_RED, COLOR_GREEN, COLOR_YELLOW, COLOR_BLUE, COLOR_MAGENTA, COLOR_CYAN, COLOR_WHITE, COLOR_BLACK;
Note that color 0 is treated the same as COLOR_BLACK (8); also note that a black receiver is not always in an active state, rather it is treated as an "any" receiver [to be implemented]

If unsure about the default configuration of each object, check objects.lua for the default objects.
Duly note that hasMask, rotateByEights and canChangeState are only defined within the default objects and not every single object.

FUN IDEAS
_________________________________________________________________
You can change level.x_val, level.y_val, level.drawbox_mode and call love.resize() (with 3rd argument dontResetUI true for efficiency) to emulate a screenshake!
Custom backgrounds with draw operations to background canvas!
Custom drawing on walls ith draw operations to overlay canvas!
